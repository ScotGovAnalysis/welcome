# Making your email address public on your GitHub profile

It is important to have your gov.scot email address public on your GitHub profile so that organisation admins can contact you if required.

To check if your email address is public, go to your GitHub profile. Your email should be visible on the left hand side of the page under your profile photo/icon.

## How to

If you can't see your email address here, follow these steps to add it:

1. Go to your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)
2. Select your gov.scot email address from the dropdown under 'Public email'
3. Click the green 'Update profile' button
