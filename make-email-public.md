# Making your email address public on your GitHub profile

It is important to have your gov.scot email address public on your GitHub profile. This helps organisation admins to verify you are a Scottish Government employee and contact you if required.

## How to

To check if your email address is public, go to your GitHub profile (select your profile photo/icon in top-right of screen, then 'Your profile'). Your email should be visible on the left hand side of the page under your profile photo/icon.

If you can't see your email address here, follow these steps to add it:

1. Go to your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)
2. Select your gov.scot email address from the dropdown under 'Public email'
3. Scroll down the page to click the green 'Update profile' button

## Troubleshooting

If you are unable to select an email address following the steps above, go to [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and check the following:

* Your gov.scot email address is verified
* "Keep my email addresses private" is unchecked
