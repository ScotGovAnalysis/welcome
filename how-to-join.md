# How to join the Data Science Scotland organisation on GitHub

## Why should I join?

This GitHub organisation is for analysts in Scottish Government to code and collaborate in the open. 

## Request to join

[Create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/welcome/issues) using the template for new member requests.

You will be asked to confirm the following:

- You are a current employee of the Scottish Government
- You have read and understand the [user responsibilities](http://saltire/orgspaces/Analytic-Professions/Analytical-Tools/Pages/version-control-guide.aspx) for using GitHub in Scottish Government
- You have read the guidance in the [welcome](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/welcome) repo
- You have your gov.scot email address visible on your GitHub profile
- You have two factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account

Your request will then be reviewed by an organisation admin and you will receive an e-mail with an invite to join the organisation.

## Publicise your organisation membership

By default, once you accept the invite to join the organisation, your membership will be marked as private, which means only you can see it.

Make sure you are logged into GitHub, go to https://github.com/orgs/DataScienceScotland/people and locate your username in the list of members. If the list is large, you can search for your username in the search box.

In the menu to the right of your username, choose **Public** to publicise your membership.
